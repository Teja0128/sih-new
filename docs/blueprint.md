## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep saffron (#FF9933), evoking the heritage of traditional medicine while remaining vibrant. Saffron relates to knowledge and responsibility.
- Background color: Pale sand (#F5F5DC). This neutral, desaturated tint of the primary color will create a calm, supportive backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#87CEEB). A lighter, brighter, less saturated analogous hue that conveys trust.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif with an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons representing various medical conditions and diagnostic categories.
- Implement a clear, tab-based layout for easy navigation between different sections (Dashboard, Diagnosis Entry, Patient Records, Admin).
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when navigating between pages or performing actions like code search.
